# EdgeBit Cluster Agent

The cluster agent adds additional enrichment to Pod workloads tracked by [EdgeBit](https://edgebit.io) for vulnerability analysis and dependency inventory. Read [Install on Kubernetes](https://edgebit.io/docs/0.x/install-kubernetes/) for more configuration details.

EdgeBit secures your software supply chain by focusing on code that is actually running. This simplifies vulnerability management as it cuts through noise, like inbox zero for CVEs.

Less noise equals less frustration between security and engineering teams. And faster software patching, of course. Sign up at https://signup.edgebit.io.
